## What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?

Access Token and Refresh Token:

Access Token:
An access token is a credential that is used to authorize and authenticate a user's access to protected resources, such as APIs or web applications. It is typically a short-lived token that contains information about the user and permissions.
Refresh Token: A refresh token is a credential that is used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate. It is typically a long-lived token that is issued alongside an access token and is used to request a new access token when the current one expires.
How they work:

When a user logs in or authenticates, an access token and refresh token are generated and provided to the client.
The access token is included in each request to the server to access protected resources.
If the access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to request a new access token from the server without requiring the user to log in again.
The server verifies the refresh token and issues a new access token if it is valid.
Where to store them on the client-side:

Access tokens should be stored in a secure manner, such as in an HTTP-only cookie or in the browser's local storage.
Refresh tokens should be securely stored, such as in an HTTP-only cookie, as they are more sensitive and have a longer lifespan.

##  Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?
Comparison between SQL and NoSQL Databases:

SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that store data in structured tables with predefined schemas. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that store data in flexible formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-column stores. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.
Key differences:

Data Model:

SQL databases have a fixed schema, enforcing data integrity through relations and constraints. NoSQL databases have a flexible schema, allowing dynamic and unstructured data.
Scalability:

SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning they handle increased traffic by upgrading the hardware. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, allowing distribution of data across multiple servers.
Query Language:

SQL databases use SQL for querying and manipulating data. NoSQL databases use different query languages, such as MongoDB's query language or Cassandra's CQL.
ACID Compliance:

SQL databases generally provide ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure data integrity. NoSQL databases often sacrifice some ACID properties for scalability and performance.


## What is express js? What is Nest JS?

Express.js:

Express.js is a fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features and tools to build web applications and APIs easily. It simplifies the process of creating server-side applications by providing an intuitive API for handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and more. Express.js is widely used in the Node.js ecosystem and allows developers to build scalable and modular web applications.
Nest.js:

Nest.js is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It is built on top of Express.js and enhances it by providing additional features, such as dependency injection, TypeScript support, modular architecture, and powerful CLI. Nest.js follows the principles of Angular, which makes it suitable for building complex applications with a well-structured codebase.

## What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work ?
MongoDB Aggregate:

MongoDB Aggregate is a powerful aggregation framework provided by MongoDB for data processing and analysis. It allows developers to perform advanced operations on collections, including filtering, grouping, sorting, joining, and transforming data. The aggregation pipeline consists of multiple stages, where each stage applies a specific operation to the data and passes the result to the next stage. With the aggregation framework, developers can perform complex queries and transformations on large datasets efficiently and effectively.
